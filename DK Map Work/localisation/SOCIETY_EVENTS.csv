EVTDESC_PTAH_11;[From.GetFirstName] to [Root.GetFirstName], greetings\n\nThe Gods need our service from time to time, lest they damn us. Your time has come. I invite you to serve Ptah for a period of 4 months at his temple in Memphis.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_12;After deciding to dedicate the next four months to serving at the temple, I immediately set out to prepare my lands for my absence. After delegating all of my responsibilities to my subordinates and packing my bags, I set off towards Memphis.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PTAH_12;Let's go!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_13;After travelling for three days through sun and desert, I was finally greeted by the white walls of Memphis. Soon enough, the two towers of the temple came into view. The white linen clothes, worn by priests, stood out from the yellow sandstone: the priesthood was awaiting my arrival and guided me inside.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PTAH_13;It begins;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_15;I entered the temple and I was guided by [From.GetFirstName]. As we were finishing the tour, I followed [From.GetFirstName] to a chair and small table with a knife. [From.GetSheHe] explained that to show my devotion to Ptah, I would need to have my hair shaved off so that lice and other impure filth would not spread in his temple. [From.GetSheHe] firmly grabbed the knife and...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PTAH_15;I let [From.GetHerHim] do [From.GetHerHis] thing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_20;After four months I stepped foot outside of the temple to return to the regular world. As the priests and priestesses said goodbye and I started travelling home, I started reflecting on my time at the temple: about the service I rendered to Ptah and the relationships I built with my fellow worshippers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PTAH_20;It was worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_30;Dozens of Nubian men were running for their lives as they were being chased down by the Great Ancestor in his chariot, swiftly followed by his armies. A truly epic painting. It had to have been made around 1000 years ago and cracks in the paint have started appearing. Should the painting be restored to bring renewed glory to the Great Ancestor and Egypt?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PTAH_30;I should fix it and make the gods proud!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PTAH_30;I should tell one of the priests.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_PTAH_30;Nobody uses this area of the temple. It would be a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_31;The next morning I was surrounded by the rings of coin being exchanged and the chattering at the local market. I purchased some pigments from an over-eager seller. After returning to the painting I started mixing the colors. As soon as I had mixed my blue, red and yellow shades I noticed that I had forgot to account for whites and blacks.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PTAH_31;I need to have those other colors.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PTAH_31;It will have to do.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_PTAH_31;This is all too complicated...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_32;The next day, I returned to the market and visited an all too familiar seller. I purchased some limestone and charcoal and made some white and black pigments. In the evening, I was back to mixing colors at the painting. After preparing all of the required colors, I started painting...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PTAH_32;This is going to look so great!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_33;I gripped the small bundle of fibres and dipped the tip in my pigments. I raised the brush to the level of my chest and carefully stroked the tip on the wall to apply new colors to the painting. My focus did not flinch for I would ruin the painting if I was not careful. After several hours, I was looking at a fully restored painting showcasing the glory of the Great Ancestor.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PTAH_33;I should be proud!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PTAH_33;I made do with what I had.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_34;I arrived at my regular relaxation spot: it was at the painting of the Great Ancestor. I noticed something was different. The worn background near the vanquished Nubians had been filled in. The ornamentations of the chariots were clearly shown now. The painting had been restored by a mysterious visitor and whoever it was, they had certainly done a great job. Should I tell the priests about this?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PTAH_34;I should tell them about this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PTAH_34;<You are stunned by the quality of the painting>;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_36;I walking through the central square when [From.GetFirstName] approached me. He stated that another member of the cult had noticed one of the old paintings had been worked on even though the cult did not commission an artist to restore it. Afterwards, he asked the question that I had expected all along: "Do you know anything about this?".;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PTAH_36;I should tell [From.GetFirstName] that I restored the painting.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PTAH_36;<Deny any involvement>;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_38;After what felt like an eternity, but was really a few seconds [From.GetFirstName] said 'I have to ask someone else then. We really want to find the person who restored the painting on the wall'. With that, [From.GetFirstName] stepped aside and left to talk to another worshipper.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PTAH_38;Phew...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_39_TRUTH;'The gods do not deserve their homes to turn to dust and sometimes all it takes is the initiative of a [Root.GetManWoman] to resolve it. It think you did a great job and you will certainly be favored by the gods! You should be proud of your effort.';;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_39_LIE;'There is no need to be humble, [Root.GetFirstName]. I know that you restored the painting. The gods do not deserve their homes to turn to dust and sometimes all it takes is the initiative of a [Root.GetManWoman] to resolve it. It think you did a great job and you will certainly be favored by the gods!';;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PTAH_39;Thank you, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_40_TRUTH;'Your work on the painting has restored an Egyptian Epic. It is a great sight to see the Great Ancestor vanquishing the Nubians with the grace of Osiris. The painting and your actions exemplify the virtues of the great Egyptian civilisation. You should be proud of yourself to restore such a work!';;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_40_LIE;'Your humility is as commendable as your work on restoring an Egyptian Epic. It is a great sight to see the Great Ancestor vanquishing the Nubians with the grace of Osiris. The painting and your actions exemplify the virtues of the great Egyptian civilisation. You should be proud of yourself to restore such a work!';;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PTAH_40;That is great to hear, [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_41_TRUTH;'Perhaps you can learn something here. While at home you might be able to do anything you see fit, here we serve the gods and their servant, the high priest. Nothing here happens without their knowledge. Your initiative to restore the painting went outside of his authority and you have honestly made an embarassment of yourself. You will be kept under close watch from now on.';;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_PTAH_41_LIE;'I can recognise a lie when I hear one, [Root.GetFirstName]. Your initiative to restore the painting went far above your authority and the results are disastrous. The painting depicting the might of the Egyptian gods has been completely ruined and it is all because of you! You will be kept under close watch from now on.';;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_PTAH_41;I'm sorry, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PTAH_42_TRUTH;'Your honesty is commendable, but your initiative to restore the painting is not. You have single-handedly destroyed a painting that has decorated these walls for many centuries and you have defaced the work of the artisans who now rest in the Duat, destroying their lasting legacy in the world of the living.';;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_PTAH_42_LIE;'Your skills in lying are as good as your skills in painting. You have single-handedly destroyed a painting that has decorated these walls for many centuries and you have defaced the work of the artisans who now rest in the Duat, destroying their lasting legacy in the world of the living.';;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_PTAH_42;This is bad.;;;;;;;;;;;x
