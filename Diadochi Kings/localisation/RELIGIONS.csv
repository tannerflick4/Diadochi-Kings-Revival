kemetic_DESC;The Ancient Egyptian religion had a complex pantheon of Gods, the most important of which were Amun, Horus, Isis, Osiris, and Ra, among many others. The Pharaohs were believed to be directly descended from the Gods and because of this the religion was very much organised by the state. Interaction between the Gods and humans was a very important aspect of the religion, with it being believed that everything that existed was somehow connected to the Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berber_main_DESC;The Ancient Berber pantheon contained native Gods as well as foreign influences from the Egyptians, Phoenicians, and the Greeks. In turn, the Berber religion influenced these people as well. The worship of the sun, moon, rivers, and natural rock formations were also an important component of the Berber religion. Because of the nature of Berber society and culture, the religion was much less centralised than others at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
illyrian_main_DESC;Little is known of the structure of the Illyrian religion, but it can be surmised that it was very decentralised due to the fractious nature of the Illyrian tribes. It is also probable that the religion was generally similar to the Daco-Thracian religions. Local Gods predominated among the tribe, yet didn't seem to spread their influence further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
thracian_main_DESC;Not much is known of the structure of the main Thracian religion, but it is likely that it wasn't as centralised as other religions of the era because of the lack of a Thracian central religious authority or state. The most prominent God across the region however seems to be Sabazios who was often portrayed as a horseman bearing a staff entwined with a snake. There was of course a pantheon of other Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zalmoxism_DESC;There is much confusion concerning the religion based around Zalmoxis, a Thracian God-turned-human prohet and (possibly) back again into a God-like form. The religion was exclusive to the more northerly Daco-Thracian peoples such as the Getae and the Dacians. By the time of Trajan's conquest, Zalmoxism was a very organised state religion based around the king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
celtic_main_DESC;The Celtic religion covered an immense area in Europe, yet surprisingly there was a degree of orthodoxy. The druid class were second in society only to the nobility and were intermediaries between humans and the Gods. Furthermore, the Celts believed that the Gods and spirits were present in all natural beings and because of this there was a reverance for nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
punic_main_DESC;The Carthaginian religion was an evolution of the Canaanite religion found along the coast of the Levant. The two supreme Gods were Baal-Hammon and Tanit, the latter actually being a borrowing from the indigenous Berbers and the former being a combination of the Canaanite Baal and the Egyptian/Berber Amon. The religion was administered by a well organised caste of priests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
canaanite_main_DESC;The Canaanite pantheon contained a great deal of Gods, with some having widespread worship while others were confined to certain regions. The religion showed many Mesopotamian and Egyptian influences. The Kings played a significant role in the administering of the religious rites and festivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zoroastrian_main_DESC;The Zoroastrian faith was based on the writings of Zarathushtra, who simplified the Indo-Iranian pantheon into two opposing forces: Illuminating Wisdom and Destructive Spirit. Ahura Mazda lead the former whilst Angra Mainyui lead the latter. It was the duty of humanity to fight against all forms of the Destructive Spirit. However the victory of the Illuminating Wisdom was seen to be inevitable, leading to a much more optimistic faith. The arrival of the Saoshyant would herald the end of time and therefore the destruction of all evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zurvanism_DESC;The Zurvanite heresy was generally similar to Zoroastrianism, except that its adherents believed that Zurvan was the primordial creator and therefore was a neutral mediator in the conflict between Illuminating Wisdom and Destructive Spirit. Furthermore, adherents believed that Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyui were twins and therefore equal but separate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
scythian_main_DESC;The Scythians had a pantheon of seven Gods, the supreme one being Tabiti. However the Scythians built places of worship to only one god: Agin, who the Greeks likened to Ares. A hereditary caste of priests who had received the gift of prophesy from the Goddess Argimpasa, used wood from willow and linden trees during their divinational rites. Horse sacrifice was incredibly common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hinduism_main_DESC;Early Hinduism refers to the transition period between the Vedic era and the development of Classical Hinduism. The older Gods Indra, Agni, and Soma were still supreme while the Gods that would come to later prominence were still marginal at this time. Like the related Zoroastrianism, reverance of the elements of fire and water were central to the faith. The religion was administered by an organised clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
armenian_main_DESC;The Armenian religion was significantly influenced by Zoroastrianism, particularly with the prevalence of fire temples. The worship of animals, especially birds, was also an important part of the Armenian religion, as was the worship of celestial bodies. Otherwise not much is known of the Armenian religion before their conversion to Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
judaism_main_DESC;Early Judaism was a continuation of the Canaanite religion, under the auspice of Abraham. During the Babylonian Captivity Yahweh, one of the Canaanite Gods, gradually became the One God of the Jewish faith. Following the Achaemenid conguest of the Babylonian Empire and the Jews' subsequent return to Judea, the priestly class became dominant and set about reforming the religion into a more unified form. Such actions include the revising of the earlier parts of the canon, the codification of the Tanakh, and the increasing importance of the synagogue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jainism_main_DESC;Jainism was an Indian religion which prescribed a path of non-violence and toleration for all living beings, as well as a strictly ascetic lifestyle. Whilst a monastic lifestyle was not required, it was encouraged. Furthermore there was no priestly class in the religion even though sects that worshiped idols could employ a servant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
buddhism_main_DESC;"Buddhism was an Indian religion founded by Siddhartha Gautama, who would later become known as the Buddha, meaning ""awakened one"". The purpose of the religion was to end suffering through the elimination of ignorance and craving, thereby achieving the sublime state of nirvana. There were three tiers of ascetic principles similar to Jainism, yet only the first tier was required for average adherents. The Bodhisattvas were enlightened beings who chose to stay and actively help those who had not yet achieved enlightenment.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
georgian_main_DESC;Little is known of the early Georgian religion, except that there was a large pantheon headed by Armazi. There also seems to have been some Persian influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anatolian_main_DESC;The Anatolian religion is the remnants of the older Hittite religion, which boasted over a thousand Gods. Primarily Indo-European in origin, the Anatolians borrowed from Mesopotamian, Hurrian, and Hattian influences. Tarhunt and his wife Arinniti were the two principle Gods. There seems to have been a well organised state clergy, and the main method of worship was through large Huwasi stones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
marduk_cult_DESC;The Mesopotamian religion was a diverse set of gods and beliefs which spread over most of the Fertile Crescent. Particularly important gods were Ashur and Marduk. The religion inspired many others in the region, such as Judaism, and the various Iranian and Anatolian faiths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
arabic_main_DESC;The ancient Arabic religion had a pantheon headed by Hubal and his three daughters, Al-lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat. Even before the advent of Islam, pilgramages to the Kaaba in Mecca were essential in the worship of the Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
greek_main_DESC;The religion of the ancient Greeks was based around the worship of the pantheon of inter-related Gods lead by Zeus. The religion was highly syncretic though and the Greeks practiced the policy of Interpretatio Graeca: the equation of foreign Gods with their own. In hindsight this was incredibly useful because most of the foreign peoples the Greeks encountered were fellow Indo-Europeans and so would have a religion derived from the same source. Festivals dedicated to certain Gods were commonplace and always included the ritualistic slaughter of livestock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
roman_main_DESC;'Greco-Italic' is the term used to refer to the religion practiced by the Italic peoples who were significantly influenced by Greek and Etruscan religious beliefs. In-game it isn't called 'Roman' because of the possibility of Rome's early demise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pontic_main_DESC;The Greco-Persian religion is a syncretisation primarily of the Greek and Zoroastrian pantheons. There was also significant influences from the various religions of Anatolia. Large temples were dedicated to specific Gods and worship seems to have been in the Greek manner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
etruscan_main_DESC;The Etruscans believed that all of visible creation was the manifestation of divine power. Their pantheon was lead by the trio of Tinia, Uni, and Cel. Menrva later replaced Cel under Greek influence. A highly organised caste of priests led the population through worship by using haruspicy, the inspection of dissected animal organs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
phrygian_main_DESC;The Phrygian religion was lead by two gods, Kubeleya (Cybele) and Sabazios. Though it had Thracian roots, it was primarily influenced by the surrounding Anatolian religions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dravidian_main_DESC;The Dravidian religion was the pre-Vedic religion of the Dravidian peoples of the Indian subcontinent before the arrival of the Indo-Aryans. Worship was led by a female priest caste and was usually restricted to local village gods and spirits. Many of these deities made it into the Vedic pantheon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
atenist;Atenist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GOD_ATEN;Aten;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
atenist_DESC;The Atenist religion was a monotheistic heresy of the Ancient Egyptian religion. Atenists worship Aten, the sun-disk, which is just an element of Ra in the Ancient Egyptian religion. This heresy was brought about by Amenhoteb IV, later known as Akhenaten, and was the state religion of Egypt for a while. However, after only 20 years, the heresy was eradicated by future Pharaohs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lusitanian_main_DESC;The religion of the Lusitanians was based around the worship of many gods, of which, Endovelicus, god of healing, seems to be the most important. The Lusitanian religion seems to have been influenced by the Celtic one, as evidenced by theonyms that appear to be related to Celtic names. That is not to say that the Lusitanians did not influence their neighbours, of course; the Gallaecians were heavily influenced by the Lusitanians, for example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
